# Caesar Cipher

The Caesar cipher, also known as a shift cipher, is one of the simplest forms of encryption. It is a substitution cipher where each letter in the original message (called the plaintext) is replaced with a letter corresponding to a certain number of letters up or down in the alphabet.

## HINTS

Create a new file with a `.js` extension and start writing JavaScript! Make sure you're function is exported from the node module. Execute your program by running it with the `node` command. e.g.:

```sh
$ node program.js
```

When you are done, you must run:

```sh
$ {appname} verify program.js
```

to proceed. Your program will be tested, a report will be generated, and the lesson will be marked 'completed' if you are successful.
