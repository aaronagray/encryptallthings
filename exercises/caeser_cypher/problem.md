# Caesar Cipher

The Caesar Cipher is a type of 'shift cyper' where each letter of the original
message is replaced with a letter a certain distance up or down the alphabet
(called the 'shift length' or key).

For example, a Caeser Cipher is applied to the message `"Cat"` with a shift
length of `3` would return `"Fdx"`. Each letter in the cipher text (encrypted
message) is 3 letters down the alphabet from the original letter.

In this exercise, a message and key (between -25 and 25) will be passed in as
the second and third arguments, respectively. Your program must return the
cipher text.

## HINTS

Create a new file with a `.js` extension and start writing JavaScript! Make sure
you're function is exported from the node module. Execute your program by
running it with the `node` command. e.g.:

```sh $ node program.js ```

When you are done, you must run:

```sh $ {appname} verify program.js ```

to proceed. Your program will be tested, a report will be generated, and the
lesson will be marked 'completed' if you are successful.
